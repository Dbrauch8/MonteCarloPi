	1. Why do we multiply the value from step 5 above by 4? 
  
  Because the array is only concerned with coordinates in 1/4 of the circle. 
  In order to account for all four quadrants, we must multiply by 4.

	2. What do you observe in the output when running your program with parameters of increasing size? 
  
  The margin of error from the actual value of decreases 

	3. If you run the program multiple times with the same parameter, does the output remain the same? Why or why not?
  
  The margin of error between the estimate and the actual value of Pi is more consistent with higher numbers, but fluctuates 
  when the same number of points are tested. This si because the points are being randomly generated. 
  
	4. Find a parameter that requires multiple seconds of run time. What is that parameter? How accurate is the estimated value of Ï€?

  An input of 100,000,000 returned an estimate of 3.14175372 for Pi.A difference of .00016


	5. Research one other use of Monte-Carlo methods. Record it in your exercise submission and be prepared to discuss it in class.
  Financial institutions utilize the Monte-Carlo method to provide accurate estimates for the performance of investments over time.
